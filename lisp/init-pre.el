  ;; This function is improved by ChatGPT :)
  ;; Explanation from ChatGPT,

  ;; This function `which-linux-release-info` can be called interactively or
  ;; used in other functions, passing an argument to indicate which information
  ;; type ("distributor" or "release") to retrieve. For example, to get the
  ;; Linux distributor, call `(which-linux-release-info "distributor")`. The
  ;; function will return the output of running the `lsb_release` command with
  ;; the appropriate option based on the information type specified. Note that
  ;; this will only work on Linux systems and will not work on other operating
  ;; systems.

;; Difference between exec-path and PATH
;; The value of environment variable "PATH" is used by emacs when you are trying to call a linux command from a shell in emacs.
;; The exec-path is used by emacs itself to find programs it needs for its features, such as spell checking, file compression, compiling, grep, diff, etc.
;; The value of (getenv "PATH") and exec-path do not need to be the same.
